    "# 🪶 BujoNow: A Bullet Journal Companion Powered by Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "**BujoNow** is an AI-powered journaling assistant that listens, reads, and sees — helping users to plan tasks to achieve their goals, record their thoughts, and reflect by journaling through text, audio, and image inputs. Built with Gemini and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), this tool offers journaling through chatting, take in the journal, analyzes journal entries and returns insightful feedback on mental wellness. This is a Capstone Project as part of the 5-day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google. \n",

    "## ✨ Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Journal Entry Analysis with Gemini + RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Powered by Google’s **Gemini API**, this feature processes free-text journal entries and returns structured emotional insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Record Journal from Chats**: You can plan and record your day while chatting\n",
    "- **Emotion Detection**: Identifies the user’s dominant emotion  \n",
    "- **Theme Extraction**: Pulls out 2–3 key themes  \n",
    "- **CBT-style Suggestions**: Offers a reflection strategy inspired by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  \n",
    "- **Affirmation Generation**: Provides a personalized daily affirmation  \n",
    "- **Context-Aware**: Uses **RAG** over curated mental wellness tips to ground responses\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example input:  \n",
    "> _“I feel overwhelmed and tired. I didn’t get much done today.”_\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example recorded Journal:\n",
    "\n",
    ">  =============================================\n",
    "> ## 2025-04-16 - Daily\n",
    "> This was a tiring day\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Emotional State\n",
    "> {'emotion': 'tired', 'themes': ['fatigue', 'exhaustion'], 'suggestion': 'Reflect on what activities drained you today and consider strategies to manage your energy better.', 'affirmation': 'It’s okay to have bad days and ask for support when you need it.'}\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Tags\n",
    "> tiring, self-care\n",
    "\n",
    "> =============================================\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Audio Transcription and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can speak their journal entries via `.m4a` or `.wav` uploads. The tool will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transcribe speech using **Google Speech Recognition**\n",
    "- Automatically convert `.m4a` to `.wav` if needed\n",
    "- Pass the transcription into the journal analyzer pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Emotion Detection from Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Upload a photo of yourself, and the tool uses facial expression recognition to determine your likely mood:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detects expressions like *happy*, *sad*, *angry*, *surprised*, etc.\n",
    "- Built using the **FER** (Facial Emotion Recognition) library and MTCNN face detection\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Mood Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn journal entries into long-term insight with:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mood Trend Over Time\n",
    "A line graph of your emotional score over multiple days:\n",
    "- Maps moods into a 1–5 range (e.g., `hopeless = 1`, `grateful = 5`)\n",
    "- Highlights growth, stability, or downward spirals visually\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Emotion Distribution\n",
    "See what emotions dominate across entries:\n",
    "- Simple bar chart of emotion frequency\n",
    "- Great for identifying emotional patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word Cloud\n",
    "Explore the most common concepts in your journal entries:\n",
    "- Filters stopwords and stems for cleaner results\n",
    "- Visualizes top recurring topics from your reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Setting Goals and Provide Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Goals\n",
    "By inputting your personal goals, provide AI-assited tips on how to achieving the goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Weekly Summary\n",
    "At the end of each week, BujoNow generates a summary of your emotional journey, highlighting the primary emotions and themes that emerged, as well as any actionable suggestions for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI Capabilities in BujoNow:\n",
    "### 1. Structured (JSON) Output\n",
    "Gemini 2.0 Flash: This version of Gemini generates structured JSON responses from journal text. The response includes emotional insights, themes, suggestions, and affirmations, providing a well-organized, consistent format for each journal entry's analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Sampling Control: \n",
    "To increase diversity in responses, BujoNow uses sampling techniques such as temperature (set to 0.8), top-p (nucleus sampling at 0.9), and top-k (50 tokens considered at each step). These settings introduce controlled randomness, ensuring varied yet coherent responses based on journal inputs. By adjusting these parameters, the system can provide more dynamic and diverse feedback, enriching the user experience with multiple perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "Contextual Grounding: RAG is implemented by embedding mental health best practices and retrieving the most relevant advice based on the journal entry. The top-k most relevant contexts are fetched to guide the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions Used: This process is facilitated through get_top_context(), embed_content(), and cosine similarity to find and retrieve the best matching context, ensuring personalized, context-driven feedback. The embeddings help score how closely journal entries align with mental health practices or themes, enhancing the quality and relevance of the feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Image Understanding\n",
    "Facial Emotion Recognition (FER): Using facenet-pytorch, BujoNow extracts emotional expressions from user-uploaded images, allowing it to assess emotions like happiness, sadness, or anger directly from facial expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Audio Understanding\n",
    "Speech Recognition: BujoNow supports voice journal entries via speech recognition with the recognize_google() function from the speech_recognition library, transcribing spoken input into text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotion & Content Analysis: After transcription, the text is analyzed for emotional content, and suggestions or insights are provided based on the emotional and thematic aspects of the audio journal entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Few-Shot Prompting\n",
    "Prompt Design: The Gemini model is provided with few-shot examples that demonstrate how journal entries map to structured responses. This improves the model's ability to process and generate consistent feedback based on various journal input styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Function Calls through Chatbot\n",
    "Interactive Chatbot: The chatbot can execute function calls to provide real-time feedback, analyze journal entries, and suggest actionable steps based on the emotional context. It integrates seamlessly with the user's mood-tracking experience, ensuring a conversational and personalized interaction."
